# From v2.x to v3.0

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning principles](https://semver.org/) and, contrary to upgrade a minor version \(where the middle number changes\) where no difficulty should be encountered, upgrade a major version \(where the first number changes\) is subject to significant modifications.

## Update the libraries <a id="update-the-libraries"></a>

First of all, you have to make sure you are using the last v2.x release \(v2.1.7 at the time of writing\).

## Spot deprecations <a id="spot-deprecations"></a>

Next, you have to verify you donâ€™t use any deprecated class, interface, method or property. If you have PHPUnit tests, [you can easily get the list of deprecation used in your application](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/phpunit_bridge.html).

## Upgrade the libraries <a id="upgrade-the-libraries"></a>

It is now time to upgrade the libraries. In your composer.json, change all `web-auth/*` dependencies from `v2.x` to `v3.0`. When done, execute `composer update`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This may also update other dependencies. You can list upgradable libraries by calling `composer outdated`. Please make sure these libraries do not impact your upgrade.
