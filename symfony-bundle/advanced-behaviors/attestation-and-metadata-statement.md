# Attestation and Metadata Statement

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disclaimer: you **should not** ask for the Attestation Statement unless you are working on an application that requires a high level of trust (e.g. Banking/Financial Company, Government Agency...).
{% endhint %}

With Symfony, you must enable this feature to enable all the metadata types.

{% code title="config/packages/webauthn.yaml" %}
```yaml
webauthn:
    metadata_service:
        enabled: true
        repository: 'App\Repository\MyMetadataStatementRepository'
```
{% endcode %}

You can set the Google API key for the Android SafetyNet Attestation Statement support with the following configuration:

```yaml
webauthn:
    android_safetynet:
        http_client: 'my.psr18.http.client'
        request_factory: 'my.psr17.request_factory'
```

If you have some troubles when validating Android SafetyNet Attestation Statement, this may be caused by the leeway of the server clocks or the age of the statement. You can modify the default values as follows:

```yaml
webauthn:
    android_safetynet:
        max_age: 60000 # in milliseconds. Default set to 60000 = 1 min
        leeway: 2000 # in milliseconds. Default set to 0
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The modification of these parameters is not recommended. You should try to sync your server clock first.
{% endhint %}

### Credential Creation Options

By default, no Attestation Statement is asked to the Authenticators (type = `none`). To change this behavior, you just have to set the corresponding parameter in the `Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` object.

There are 3 conveyance modes available using PHP constants provided by the class `Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions`:

* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_NONE`: the Relying Party is not interested in authenticator attestation (default)
* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_INDIRECT`: the Relying Party prefers an attestation conveyance yielding verifiable attestation statements, but allows the client to decide how to obtain such attestation statements.
* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_DIRECT`: the Relying Party wants to receive the attestation statement as generated by the authenticator.

#### The Symfony Way

{% code title="config/packages/webauthn.yaml" %}
```yaml
webauthn:
    credential_repository: ...
    user_repository: ...
    creation_profiles:
        acme:
            attestation_conveyance: !php/const Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions::ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_DIRECT
            rp:
                name: 'My application'
                id: 'example.com'
```
{% endcode %}
